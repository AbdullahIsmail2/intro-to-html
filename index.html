					Mount Everest, towering at a staggering 8,848 meters (29,029 feet)
					above sea level, is not only the highest peak on Earth but also a
					symbol of human determination and endurance. Nestled in the majestic
					Himalayas, on the border between Nepal and the Tibet Autonomous Region
					of China, Everest has captivated adventurers and climbers for
					generations. The history of its ascents is filled with tales of
					triumph and tragedy, from the first successful climb by Sir Edmund
					Hillary and Tenzing Norgay in 1953 to the countless stories of those
					who have since sought to conquer its icy slopes. Climbers face extreme
					conditions, including sub-zero temperatures, fierce winds, and the
					notorious "Death Zone" above 8,000 meters, where the lack of oxygen
					makes each step a monumental effort. Despite these challenges, the
					allure of standing atop the world's highest point continues to draw
					people from around the globe, making Everest a timeless beacon of
					exploration and human spirit.
